## When to use
This allows for using a different evaluation strategy based on a particular field obtained dynamically from the current scanned image.

- Sometimes OMR sheets contain a bubble that indicates Set A, Set B where the questions might be shuffled
- Or there is a subject code field, so that same OMR sheet is reused for different subjects and then scanned together to evaluate based on that subject code field
